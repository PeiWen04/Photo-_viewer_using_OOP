# üñºÔ∏è Photo Viewer

A **menu-driven photo management application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The program enables users to efficiently manage their photo collections with features like viewing, deleting, restoring, and marking photos as favorites.

---

## üß† Overview

The **Photo Viewer** program provides a user-friendly interface for managing photos.
Users can:

* Display photos
* Add to favorites
* Delete photos
* Restore from recently deleted photos
* Permanently delete photos after 30 days

This project demonstrates the implementation of **OOP concepts** such as inheritance, composition, and encapsulation through a **Doubly Linked List** structure.

## üß© Program Structure

### **1. Base Class**

#### `DoubleLinkedList.cpp`

* Handles the creation, linking, and manipulation of nodes.
* Supports traversing, displaying, and searching within the list.

### **2. Derived Classes**

#### `Gallery.cpp`

* Inherits from `DoubleLinkedList`.
* Manages the main photo gallery, including editing, deleting, and favoriting photos.

#### `RecentDelete.cpp`

* Inherits from `DoubleLinkedList`.
* Manages recently deleted photos, allowing users to restore or permanently delete them.

#### `Favourite.cpp`

* Inherits from `DoubleLinkedList`.
* Handles the favorite photos list and allows for deletion from both favorite and main galleries.

### **3. Composition**

* `Gallery` contains instances of `RecentDelete` and `Favourite` to manage deleted and favorite photos cohesively.
* `Favourite` also contains a `RecentDelete` instance to manage photos deleted from favorites.

## üåü Features

* **Add Photo** ‚Äì Insert new photos into the gallery.
* **Display Photos** ‚Äì View all photos in the gallery.
* **Delete Photo** ‚Äì Move photos to the recently deleted section.
* **Restore Photo** ‚Äì Recover photos from the recently deleted list.
* **Favorite Management** ‚Äì Add or remove photos from favorites.
* **Automatic Cleanup** ‚Äì Photos in the recently deleted list are purged after 30 days.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system uses a **Doubly Linked List** as the core data structure, allowing efficient insertion and deletion of photos from any position.
Through OOP:

* **Inheritance** ensures reusability and extension of common methods.
* **Composition** allows managing linked components (gallery, favorites, deleted photos).
* **Encapsulation** ensures that data manipulation is done safely via class methods.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Data Structure:** Doubly Linked List

*(Originally conceptualized in C++ but implemented here in Python for clarity and testing ease.)*
